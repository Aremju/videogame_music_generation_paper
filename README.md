# Adaptive and Generative Music in Video games

Latex repository which holds the Information of our paper "Adaptive and Generative Music Generation"

## Abstract

Adaptive and generative music are two techniques
commonly used in video games to create an immersive audio
environment. Adaptive music modifies the game’s soundtrack
in response to the player’s actions, while generative music uses
algorithms to produce unique compositions in real-time. Both
techniques provide game developers with powerful tools to craft
engaging and memorable gaming experiences, and they are
continually evolving with the latest technological advancements.
Despite this progress, there are still technical limitations that
hinder the commercial implementation of academic adaptive or
generative music systems in real video games. In this paper, we
introduce a range of frequently developed adaptive and generative 
music systems, explore their functionality, and evaluate
their performance in terms of gameplay immersion. We also
discuss the differences between these systems, their advantages
and disadvantages, and potential future enhancements.
