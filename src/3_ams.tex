\section{Adaptive Music System (Julius)}

In the year 2019, the authors Patrick Hutchings and Jon McCormack
introduced the Adaptive Music System (AMS) \cite{hutMcCormAms} 
and tested it with several evaluators. It was developed as a
stand-alone package that receives game information from the
video game itself in real-time to generate a model of the game-
state and output music from this state \cite{hutMcCormAms}. Their
system is divided into two main components: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item A spreading activation model to read the game's information \cite{hutMcCormAms}.
    \item The music generation system that uses the spreading activation model output to generate its music \cite{hutMcCormAms}. 
\end{enumerate}
