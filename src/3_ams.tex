\section{Adaptive Music System}

In the year 2019, the authors Patrick Hutchings and Jon McCormack
introduced the Adaptive Music System (AMS) \cite{hutMcCormAms} 
and tested it with several evaluators. It was developed as a
stand-alone package that receives game information from the
video game itself in real-time to generate a model of the game-
state and output music from this state \cite{hutMcCormAms}.
Their system is divided into two main components: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item A spreading activation model to read the game's information \cite{hutMcCormAms}.
    \item The music generation system that uses the spreading activation model output to generate its music \cite{hutMcCormAms}. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}
A first introduction of the system can be seen in \Cref{fig:ams_architecture}.
It represents the whole workflow of music generation \cite{hutMcCormAms}. The game 
acts here as an input for the Spreading Activation Model, which passes its output
to the music Composition System \cite{hutMcCormAms}. The system outputs music in
MIDI format \cite{hutMcCormAms}. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a
common music format \cite{midi_explanation} that can also be used as a protocol
between computers and synthesizers \cite{midi_explanation}. It can be also used to 
generate synthesized music \cite{midi_explanation} with many types of instruments \cite{midi_general}.
The MIDI files are then used to generate Music with specific software systems \cite{hutMcCormAms}. MIDI uses hexadecimal values in order
to represent the volume, pitch, instrument etc. \cite{midi_general}\cite{midi_explanation}.

\subsection{Spreading Activation Model}

The spreading activation model \cite{collins1975spreading} itself is a knowledge 
organisation model, which can be used to understand and capture emotion \cite{hutMcCormAms}\cite{carr1982words} in a graph, making it 
worth being used in a video game \cite{hutMcCormAms}.

For the AMS, the authors described the implementation
of the spreading activation model as a weighted and 
undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \)\cite{hutMcCormAms}, where 
\( V \) represents the vertices, and \( E \) the edges of the
graph. Each node \( V \) of the graph 
stands for a certain context \cite{hutMcCormAms}, which can
be either an affect \( (A) \), an  \( (O) \) object or an environment \( (N) \) \cite{hutMcCormAms}. A node
contains an activation value from 0 to 100 \cite{hutMcCormAms}. The 
edges of the graph stand for the level of  association 
of those context objects \cite{hutMcCormAms} 
and have normalised weights \( w_E\). Nevertheless, the authors
say that the nodes do not have to be connected, and edges do not 
form between affects \cite{hutMcCormAms}. 

Initially at the game
start, the graph contains the affect nodes sadness, happiness, 
threat, anger, tenderness and excitement \cite{hutMcCormAms}
and receives updates from the game every 30ms \cite{hutMcCormAms}.
The model uses an Open Sound Control (OSC) client to refresh
the graph with the game information, and nodes are newly generated
when a concept is not contained within the graph.

Nodes which contain a positive activation level are able to activate
adjacent nodes \cite{hutMcCormAms}. The activation done proportionally to the weights
of the edges \cite{hutMcCormAms}. For instance, if a Node A has an activation level
of 50 and has an adjacent node B, connected with an edge weight
of 0.25, Node A will activate Node B with at least 12.5 \cite{hutMcCormAms}. If
the Node has already been activated with the same or a higher
value, the vertex weight stays the same. To conclude, the activation
can be described as \[
w_B := 
\begin{cases} 
w_A * w_E & \text{if } w_A * w_E > w_B \\
w_B & \text{if not} 
\end{cases}
\] 
where \( w_A \) is the activation value of vertex A, \( w_B \)
is the activation of vertex \(B\) and \( w_E \) is the normalised value
of the edge connecting both vertices together \cite{hutMcCormAms}.

Both the activations of nodes and the weights of edges diminish
over time \cite{hutMcCormAms}. In the tested game scenarios, 
explicitly defined associations do not fade, while inferred 
associations decay at a rate of 0.01 per second and node 
activations decrease at a rate of 0.1 per second
\cite{hutMcCormAms}.
Melodic themes have been precomposed for well-known objects and are implemented as properties of object nodes within the system \cite{hutMcCormAms}. The music composition system continuously generates new music based on the knowledge contained in the graph to accompany gameplay \cite{hutMcCormAms}. 

\subsection{Music Composition System}

The authors designed their system to be a multi-agent composition system \cite{hutMcCormAms} and it is based on group dynamics of 
improvising musicians and different algorithmic composition
techniques \cite{hutMcCormAms}.
They also describe the co-agency of the system, where all agents
of the system work towards the same goal: generating music, like
real musicians would do \cite{hutMcCormAms}.
In the AMS of the authors, they implemented three different agents:
an harmony-agent, a melody-agent and a percussive rhythm-agent \cite{hutMcCormAms}.
